    "You may have encountered `dataset.prefetch` in a previous TensorFlow assignment, as an important extra step in data preprocessing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using `prefetch()` prevents a memory bottleneck that can occur when reading from disk. It sets aside some data and keeps it ready for when it's needed, by creating a source dataset from your input data, applying a transformation to preprocess it, then iterating over the dataset one element at a time. Because the iteration is streaming, the data doesn't need to fit into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can set the number of elements to prefetch manually, or you can use `tf.data.experimental.AUTOTUNE` to choose the parameters automatically. Autotune prompts `tf.data` to tune that value dynamically at runtime, by tracking the time spent in each operation and feeding those times into an optimization algorithm. The optimization algorithm tries to find the best allocation of its CPU budget across all tunable operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "To increase diversity in the training set and help your model learn the data better, it's standard practice to augment the images by transforming them, i.e., randomly flipping and rotating them. Keras' Sequential API offers a straightforward method for these kinds of data augmentations, with built-in, customizable preprocessing layers. These layers are saved with the rest of your model and can be re-used later.  Ahh, so convenient! \n",

    "\n",
    "You could try fine-tuning the model by re-running the optimizer in the last layers to improve accuracy. When you use a smaller learning rate, you take smaller steps to adapt it a little more closely to the new data. In transfer learning, the way you achieve this is by unfreezing the layers at the end of the network, and then re-training your model on the final layers with a very low learning rate. Adapting your learning rate to go over these layers in smaller steps can yield more fine details - and higher accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition for what's happening: when the network is in its earlier stages, it trains on low-level features, like edges. In the later layers, more complex, high-level features like wispy hair or pointy ears begin to emerge. For transfer learning, the low-level features can be kept the same, as they have common features for most images. When you add new data, you generally want the high-level features to adapt to it, which is rather like letting the network learn to detect features more related to your data, such as soft fur or big teeth. \n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, just unfreeze the final layers and re-run the optimizer with a smaller learning rate, while keeping all the other layers frozen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the final layers actually begin is a bit arbitrary, so feel free to play around with this number a bit. The important takeaway is that the later layers are the part of your network that contain the fine details (pointy ears, hairy tails) that are more specific to your problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, unfreeze the base model by setting `base_model.trainable=True`, set a layer to fine-tune from, then re-freeze all the layers before it. Run it again for another few epochs, and see if your accuracy improved!"
