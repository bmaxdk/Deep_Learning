    "    - To retrieve dimensions from a tensor `X`, use: `X.get_shape().as_list()`\n",
    "2. Unroll `a_C` and `a_G` as explained in the picture above\n",
    "    - You'll likely want to use these functions: [tf.transpose](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/transpose) and [tf.reshape](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/reshape).\n",
    "3. Compute the content cost:\n",
    "    - You'll likely want to use these functions: [tf.reduce_sum](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/reduce_sum), [tf.square](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/square) and [tf.subtract](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/subtract).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Additional Hints for \"Unrolling\"\n",
    "* To unroll the tensor, you want the shape to change from $(m,n_H,n_W,n_C)$ to $(m, n_H \\times n_W, n_C)$.\n",
    "* `tf.reshape(tensor, shape)` takes a list of integers that represent the desired output shape.\n",
    "* For the `shape` parameter, a `-1` tells the function to choose the correct dimension size so that the output tensor still contains all the values of the original tensor.\n",
    "* So `tf.reshape(a_C, shape=[m, n_H * n_W, n_C])` gives the same result as `tf.reshape(a_C, shape=[m, -1, n_C])`.\n",
    "* If you prefer to re-order the dimensions, you can use `tf.transpose(tensor, perm)`, where `perm` is a list of integers containing the original index of the dimensions. \n",
    "* For example, `tf.transpose(a_C, perm=[0,3,1,2])` changes the dimensions from $(m, n_H, n_W, n_C)$ to $(m, n_C, n_H, n_W)$.\n",
    "<!-- * There is more than one way you can unroll a tensor.  -->\n",
    "* Again, note that you don't necessarily need `tf.transpose` to 'unroll' the tensors in this case but this is a useful function to practice and understand for other situations that you'll encounter.\n"
